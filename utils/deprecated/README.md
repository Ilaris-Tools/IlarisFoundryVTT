# Deprecated utils

Foundry VTT had a different database structure until v10.
The following scripts were created in relation to this old version.

- create_database.js
- create_datenbank.py
- import_database.js
- start.py

In case of maintenance for the older version, these files are kept here for backwards compaitibility, but otherwise not used for newer versions of Foundry VTT.
