# Deprecated utils

Foundry VTT had a different database structure until v10.
The following scripts were created in relation to this old version.

-   create_database.js
-   create_datenbank.py
-   import_database.js
-   start.py

In case of maintenance for the older version, these files are kept here for backwards compaitibility, but otherwise not used for newer versions of Foundry VTT.
