# Utils scripts

Utility scripts that help to build the database of the Ilaris system for Foundry VTT.

Whenever there are changes in the `packs/*/_source` directories, the `pack-all.js` script should be
executed from the root level:

```bash
# Make sure to be at the root level of this repo
node utils/pack-all.js
```
